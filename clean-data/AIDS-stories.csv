Before becoming infected with HIV I was affected I met a man who had AIDS and I married him he told me that he had AIDS before I married him, so I knew, it wasn't like I didn't know because I did. I chose to married this man knowing that he had AIDS. WE had a great relationship for four years he passed. After being diagnosed I refuse to tell my husband because I didn't want him to feel responsible for me being HIV positive. So he went to his grave not knowing that I was HIV positive. Three months after he pass I decided that it was time for me to deal with the HIV status, so I decided to go to the doctor but when I went I was refuse care, so I said to myself the hell with it. I went into deep depression and finally I decided to tell my family. My family were some what supportive but but they know nothing about HIV and they were fearful, so my life was a rollercoaster and I did some things I'm not so proud of but that was than and this is now. Today I've been living with HIV 12 YEARS 26 days, my HIV status is ASYMPOMATIC meaning I never been I'll I do take medication haven't had any side effects from the medication so for and my life is not complete but it is not incomplete I take one day at a time.

This past Feb 14, 2003 I have been positive for 1 year. It has been a very diffecult year, but I have gotten by and made it through my first year of HIV. I have been on meds since the begining, my viraload was over 13,000 and my cd4 count was like 396. We I am dwn to no dectectable and only up to 450. I have been on sustiva and combivir. Thanks to GOD the meds have not given my bad side effects but yes I do feel differnt being on the meds but hey they are helping live. I have only been able to tell a few close friends within the past year, and just recently las November I told my brother in the hospital when I developed celluitous, he at the same time outted himself as being gay. We shared a tear I told him I was okay and that the meds were helping me to live but I would be on the meds for the rest of my life. I guess what I am getting at is that how do I tell my parents and the rest of my brothers and sister that I am HIV positive. I come from a hispanic strong catholic back ground family. My parents are very heavily involed in the church, but we as family have never been such a close family, we have never been a family that expressed ones feelings. When I first came out to my parents being gay they took it very hard and very unsupported. Mom and Dad are not very educated and closed minded. Up until 3 years ago they finally expected my being gay lover after meeting him, but it took them about 6 years to accept it, now he is no longer my lover and have been single since then. It has been bothering me that I have not told my parents my sitution and feel that it would be a great weight off my should if I tell them. I wish I could someones opinion wheather they have gone through the same things or if I could get another gay hispanic who is catholic to see if they have gone through the same thing that I am going through. Any response would be greatly appreiciated. Thank you to you.

I am going on my 4th year since my diagnosis. Needless to say it has been a very difficult road to walk. When I first started getting sick I did not think it was anything more than the flu. Things got worse and worse untill I had a 104 degree (farenhiet) fever and I was out of my mind . I never even thought of A.I.D.S. as that I am straight and have never I.V.'d drugs , let alone share a needle. But as it turned out I had unprotected sex with a woman whose ex boyfriend was a junkie. When they whealed me into the hospital my blood oxygen level was 46 and my cd4 was 37. I was on deaths doorstep. I had full blown A.I.D.S. with collapsed lungs from pnumosystic pnumonia. I took my medications as directed and when I got out of the hospital my legs were so atrophied from being confined to bed that I could only walk a few steps at a time. My girlfriend ( who is uninfected and still by my side ) purchased an exercise bike and I worked on it daily untill I regained my strength. I have since been on numerous long distance treks and walkabouts. I have been in Backpacker Magazine for my hike in the U.S. on The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. I just got done in March 07 with hiking The Ouachita Trail in Arkansas. I am going to Montana in 2 weeks to do another project with Backpacker. I am also planning on walking across america starting in San Francisco on Feb 11 arriving in Washington D.C. on July 11th 2007 . The project is called The Longest Walk 2 . There is plenty on the net about it. I am seriously considering making an attempt on Mt Everest in the summer of 2009. I do not know if anyone with A.I.D.S has ever climbed it. I am not going to sit on my arse and wait around for Mr. Death. He will have to catch me first, and I hike like the devil himself is chasing me. I hope that my story inspires someone to go beyond what they think is thier limits._LOVE AND PEACE Skot",http://www.hivaidspositivestories.com/text/st509.htmlJames,All races/ethnicities,Male,25-34,Illinois,./images/anonymous.jpg,"Hi, I'm 30 years old. My name is James and I am HIV-positive. I grew up in Wheaton, IL and in a good family enviorment. I was a happy child and had great childhood. After high school and two years of college, I met a wonderful and beautiful woman. She was perfect in everyway. We dated on and off and were the best of friends. Then one day it all changed. She didnt call as often, seemed out of it, and isolating herself. Around that time I heard one of her close friends turned out to be bi-sexual and had AIDS. I was a wreck and confronted her about it. After a few minutes she told me it was true and that she had had unprotected sex with him. By then I felt my stomach drop, and felt like the weight of the world was upon my shoulders. I then asked her had she been tested. She told me yes and that the results were positive. I was in shock, and I cried for days. My test results were positve and have been tested twice. Life moves on and have no choice but to learn to accept my diagnosis and learn to live again. It's very hard, and there are so many dark moments and reminders telling you, you have HIV.

It has been a long hard couple of weeks and am trying to cope. I have started on my meds and am trying to get as much information as possible on this terrible diagnosis. I am a 39 year old white mother of an 8 year old and am trying to figure out, as in a previous e-mail I read, why when talked about in the news this is a ""killer"" disease yet the doctor says ""it's chronic, like hypertension, you will be ok"". Do they just tell you that so you don't kill yourself or get depressed or what is the answer? I have been at my present job for 12 years and am wondering if I will be able to go back to work. I know I need to get back in shape and working, raising an 8 year old and working out is going to be quite a challenge. At first I had night sweats, 103 fever and was very anemic. Ended up in the hospital a few times and my counts when first diagnosed were CD4 of 57 and viral load of over 260,000. Am just wondering what to expect as I am on a constant regimin of antibiotics, anemia medication and HIV meds. Also, I have contacted two different ""support"" groups in the New Orleans area only to be told ""honey, there is nothing for you here, this is a 90% gay organization"" and the other for women supposedly to be told they can't offer any help with the meds financially because I work and really have no support groups for my ""type"". What a joke. I would love to get involved in organizations to help the spread of something like this or just get involved in some way.",http://www.hivaidspositivestories.com/text/st212.htmlAnonymous,All races/ethnicities,Female,13-24,All states,./images/anonymous.jpg,"i just found out i have hiv! i am 21 yrs old! i was helping my boyfriend move out of where he was at.

Staying on the meds was hard to do because I hated pills and drugs. I slipped and did not use a condom and to make it so bad.. I had cheated on my ex. Now the date isDecember 10th, 2006 and I am living well with Aids. The baby is now 8 and she is undetectable.:) The father whom I cheated on well , turns out, he was the one who gave it to me. It passed our first baby and that was a blessing. We were married for 5 years until he no longer supported me emotionally and he didn't want to go to a clinic to get medicine. So, I met another guy and we were married 8 months after we met. Why? well I was upfront with him because I was in love with him and after I told him- he asked me to marry him. And this March will be 2 years. We use protection all of the time. I was scared for my life but the longer I live..the more I except it, and you really do need a good support person and a good doctor. I'n not outspoken about it because it hurt me once..really bad but now I'm upfront to my daughter about her status so that she can grow with it as well as I have. When I used to think negative thoughts about telling her...there was a thought in my mind as to how she wmight react as a teenager.So I figured now is the time.

If anyone out there is listening please pay attention. I am HIV Positive I'm a 41 year old female hispanic. I was diagnosed in July 05, I was not aware that I was infected. I was in an abusive relationship 10 years ago, I have never done drugs, Iam not a smoker and I don't drink. I always lived a healthy life. This per knew that he was infected and did not give me a chance. But I should have been careful. My doctor gave me the news and went away for 2 weeks, did not referred me to the clinic or for counseling I didn't know where to go or who to talk to. I had a nervous breakdown I thought that my days were numbered. Was in the hospital for 2 weeks, had the shingles and a whole lot of stuff happened. To make my story short I am well now. I take two(2) pills at night and my viral load is undetectable, my tcells are going up. The reason why I am sharing my story is because I want to warn all of you that get diagnosed and go through the emotonal turmoil that I went thru. I joined a wellness group and a well known (AIDS)agency. At this group we share our fears our most deepest fellings with individuals that arealso HIV positive. Mentally I wasn't well I had to nurse myself back to health, was seeing a Pshychologist, a psychiatrist taking sleeping pills, anxiety pills, pills for my nerves the whole works and was suicidal. I WAS AFRAID TO DIE, I have two children and they need me here. I met a counselor at the agency he saw an easy target, I was of our state or mind. vulnerable. This person is also positive, he has been positive for the last 14 years. He gave me so much hope, when I was with him I would forget that I was positive, I went back to work, he helped me out of my depression. But the story doesn't have a happy ending. I have a fiancee but when he found out that I was positive he treats me like the worst person in the world. I cannot speak to him about hiv or my fears. my counselor (friend) was always saying that he needed some money to pay off his debts, he would say things like, I think that my viral load is sky high because Iam under so much stress and stuff like that. He borrowed $6,000.00 from me. He signed an agreement to pay back the full amount within the next 2 years. But he was a fake, he use his position to get close to me, and I was ignorant and stupid, I thought that I was returning the favor because he was always there for me. Well yesterday he was supposed to give a second payment on the loan. When I asked him about the money he came up with another one of his lies, I say this because after awhile I was catching on to his game._He is addicted to gambling, he gambled the $6,000.00, he gambled his weekly pay and then some. When I confronted him, he became verbally abusive, threatened me and all hell broke loose. I lost control of myself and one thing let to another and he was terminated from his job on the spot. He called me to acuse me of doing this to him, now I feel horrible I think that I am a monster for doing this. I have never hurt a person in my whole life, I feel so guilty. I can't stop from crying. I just want to know if I did the right thing or should have given him till the end of the month to come up with the moment. after all that i have went through and now this, my fiancee doesn't know about this, he is going to hate me even more. I lost the money that was the downpayment for the house that we were planning on buying. I don't know if I should take him to court or not, he doesn't return my calls. he had said to me now you have to give me money so I can leave the state because all of my clients how Iam going to face them.",http://www.hivaidspositivestories.com/text/st373.htmlAnonymous,Asian,Female,Adults and adolescents,Washington,./images/anonymous.jpg,"I am a mom and a wife.

I was in ICU for 3 days and not knowing were I was and didn't remmeber much. I was send home and still very sick. A year went by and my husband started having problems with his health. Then he got thrush and the doctor wanted him to be tested for HIV/AIDS we thought that was silly , knowing we have been married for 16 years at that time. So we did the test on him and found out that he has full blown AIDS. I was really scared for my kids now . I could handle it but feared for my 2 boys. I was tested and I have HIV . But I praise God that my kids don't have it. God spared them. I know I didn't get it untill years later. I did a life insurance and was tested 3 years before I found out. So I didn't get it untill I ended up in the hospital. We are doing good. I think about my children's future. SO please if you are reading this and you are being sexually active. Think of your children's future before you have kids. We are the one that make them pay for our past. Remember God will always love you, but just make the right chose in life. Sex is not the way of life when you are not married. But just remmember .... You make your own choses and you pay for what you do , good or bad. So think before you go and have sex with just any one.

Im very close with my family so I didnt hesitate to tell my parents immediately which has really helped me in this initial stage. I went home this weekened to explain everything to my parents while I tried to stay strong watching them break down with tears flying. It was tough but they came around quickly to be great support now and always. I know I caught this virus through unprotected sex with another man... Im into both men and women and I knew my lifestyle had some risk. I got tested every couple weeks because I became paranoid of not knowing. I actually studied hiv/aids on different occasions before I was diagnosed preparing myself just in case I became positive... but never thinking it would actually happen. So, yes, it was a big shock for me and still is a little bit. I guess I was in denial about my life choices and continued doing something I knew I didnt truely believe in... I mean everytime I hooked up I had to be high on some sort of drug... that cant be a good thing. The whole drug/sex scene was fascinating to me and I was sucked in by people I trusted... when really I should have trusted myself and what I knew was right and wrong. I cant blame anyone but myself. So whats next?... I know it may not be easy at times but I also know im not going to let something like this take control of my life... Im going to beat this. My goal is to find as much information as possible and continue to learn and grow. I believe it will make me a better person. I am very goal-oriented and sports minded... I have a ""never give up"" attitude. Ive been through a devastating illness before so its almost like my body has been groomed for this precarious road... Ive had full body paralysis and pneumonia amongst other things... ive beaten all of them... and I know its a result of TRUELY BELIEVING I will get through this. I am a positive person and not afraid of my positive status. So my sister asked me today if I felt ""scared""... I said ""no, not really... im aware of what people think they know but only God himself chooses the end to my story and I plan on helping him write that happy ending.""

My partner came from a het marriage with one child of 5 and wife was 4 months pregnant. All are negative (wife and kids). after a state of heavy disco drug use and final HIV fatigue - I became positive. I maintain the fact that I infected myself thorugh carelessness and love...No one is to blame -not even myself. I am interested in this idea that people are becoming fatigued to the message of safer sex -especially the 18-35 yr old age group. I beleive that this ""fatigue' is perhaps more ""fatalism' and recognise aspects of this line of thought in some of your very personal and frank stories, and beleive that people who 'slip-up' are so drawn to the idea that they have 'it' -due in part to the effective education that we here in Australia had at least, and a cycle of guilt and shame is created where people could have a three types of HIV status in one day. + then - and also unknown - The unknown being the most potent of them all. When I ceroconverted ( I don't know how to spell it but I know what it is) I went to the doctor straight away who within a 3 days of being tested informed me that I too had become infected. This maybe crazy for people to understand but I was so relieved to find out that I had it - and a tremendous weight had been lifted from my shoulders that I had been carrying around with me for some ten to fifteen years. As a response to the news, and to the luxury of of being employed in a steady and long term job in a WEstern Society, I took some time off to allow my body to heal, and then I made some decisions about what I was to do with the rest of my life. I took a series of meds that didn't make me sick. My TCell and Viral load went back to ""Normal"" (""great numbers "" My doc said). After some time off I quit my job and started in a less 'stressful' position, but more importantly I redefined my life goals. I have two beautiful children in my life who I love dearly, A partner that loves me and vice versa. Life does not end unless you want it to.

Mikey had always seemed to be sick but it wasn't until he was about 4 months old that we found out why. He was admitted to Akron Children's Hospital for a hernia. It was then that the Dr. asked if he could do an AIDS test. Well I was 17 at the time and never gave any thought to it actually coming back positive. Then two weeks later I was being told my son had full-blown AIDS and that meant I was + also. My mother tried to strangle me that day and just kept asking how could I co this to her. I still don't believe she realizes it's not what I did to her but to my children and me. See, I did not deal with this diagnosis very well and went into complete denial. Mikey passed away in Aug of 1990, but I was convinced that he did not die of AIDS that the Dr was wrong and that it was something else. My denial went on for the next two years resulting in giving birth to another AIDS-infected child, who was born three months early. Kayla became a lot sicker a lot quicker than Mikey but it wasn't until she was close to death that I began realizing that this disease was for real and now I had to deal with giving my two precious children AIDS. Which to this day is still very hard for me to deal with. At one point, the city & county health departments were going to have me committed because I was not dealing with the disease and was a risk to myself and others. Now I have finally began speaking publicly about my story and this disease but I still find it very hard to understand how or why so many people still put themselves at risk.
