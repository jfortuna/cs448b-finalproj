Before becoming infected with HIV I was affected I met a man who had AIDS and I married him he told me that he had AIDS before I married him, so I knew, it wasn't like I didn't know because I did. I chose to married this man knowing that he had AIDS. WE had a great relationship for four years he passed. After being diagnosed I refuse to tell my husband because I didn't want him to feel responsible for me being HIV positive. So he went to his grave not knowing that I was HIV positive. Three months after he pass I decided that it was time for me to deal with the HIV status, so I decided to go to the doctor but when I went I was refuse care, so I said to myself the hell with it. I went into deep depression and finally I decided to tell my family. My family were some what supportive but but they know nothing about HIV and they were fearful, so my life was a rollercoaster and I did some things I'm not so proud of but that was than and this is now. Today I've been living with HIV 12 YEARS 26 days, my HIV status is ASYMPOMATIC meaning I never been I'll I do take medication haven't had any side effects from the medication so for and my life is not complete but it is not incomplete I take one day at a time. I'm looking for a boyfriend and I know one day I'll get him so that's my story.

Im very close with my family so I didnt hesitate to tell my parents immediately which has really helped me in this initial stage. I went home this weekened to explain everything to my parents while I tried to stay strong watching them break down with tears flying. It was tough but they came around quickly to be great support now and always. I know I caught this virus through unprotected sex with another man... Im into both men and women and I knew my lifestyle had some risk. I got tested every couple weeks because I became paranoid of not knowing. I actually studied hiv/aids on different occasions before I was diagnosed preparing myself just in case I became positive... but never thinking it would actually happen. So, yes, it was a big shock for me and still is a little bit. I guess I was in denial about my life choices and continued doing something I knew I didnt truely believe in... I mean everytime I hooked up I had to be high on some sort of drug... that cant be a good thing. The whole drug/sex scene was fascinating to me and I was sucked in by people I trusted... when really I should have trusted myself and what I knew was right and wrong. I cant blame anyone but myself. So whats next?... I know it may not be easy at times but I also know im not going to let something like this take control of my life... Im going to beat this. My goal is to find as much information as possible and continue to learn and grow. I believe it will make me a better person. I am very goal-oriented and sports minded... I have a ""never give up"" attitude. Ive been through a devastating illness before so its almost like my body has been groomed for this precarious road... Ive had full body paralysis and pneumonia amongst other things... ive beaten all of them... and I know its a result of TRUELY BELIEVING I will get through this. I am a positive person and not afraid of my positive status. So my sister asked me today if I felt ""scared""... I said ""no, not really... im aware of what people think they know but only God himself chooses the end to my story and I plan on helping him write that happy ending."" Amen!",http://www.hivaidspositivestories.com/text/st490.html
