I have blacked out and had unprotected sex with many women but i was always clean and tested negative for every std until 3 months ago when i met a girl at a party. She told everyone she was clean (I don't really remember why), and she said that condoms were for wimps. That night I went home with her because I was intoxicated and in the morning i felt fine, but as the day went on i felt worse and worse. After one week i couldn't open my mouth because an absess had formed and the doctor said i had tonsilitis. I knew this couldn't be true, but i didn't want to tell him I had had unprotected sex because my mother was in the room. Long story short I decided to get tested because I was getting sick every month. I tested positive and broke down. I was heavily depressed and wondered how this girl could look e straight in the face and tell me she was clean. Anyways im still trying to get used to the fact that I have HIV. I'm fine with it now and i have realized that I will still live for at least another 10 years which is enough for me. The moral of my story is to never ever trust someone that says they are clean. Most of the time it's true, but it only takes one time.

I have been living with this disease for 15 years going on 16. I was diagnosed in 1996 and from 1996-2000 I was in so much denial I ran the streets as I had before smoking crack and just wanting to get high and higher, because I thought if I was going to die, I was going to die happy and high. So I thought. After 4 years I saw I was still here and healthy, so to speak. I decided to get help for my addiction and get educated about HIV/AIDS. I am happy and yes even proud to say that I have been clean from the drug of my choice for 6 going on 7 years and have been an HIV/AIDS Outreach Worker, Educator and Test Counselor for the same number of years and still am. I have also been a member of many groups within the government of New York: HIV/AIDS Planning Council, Advisory Group to the Planning Council, HIV/AIDS Advocate, Human and Civil Rights Advocate. I have found my passion and knowingnow that it is not a death sentence, just a change of life, I can go out and spread the word that, ""WE CAN LIVE"" and live a very happy, productive life. I have been addicted to crack for 12 years and lost everything: my job, my partner after 8 years, my home but mostly myself. I am back now with alot of thanks to many, but mostly to myself because it was me who willing and chose to get the truth and I did. I will persevere in this fight to educate and fight for the rights of HIV/AIDS people and all people who are treated unjustly........ I have never been more content and happy than now. It is now 2011, going on 47 and it is going to be 15 years that I am living with this illness. I am in control of it. It has no control over me. Still extremely happy and content with a positive attitude. Still clean from drugs going on 11 years and still in the field of Social Services. I went back to college and earned a degree which landed me job as a Case Manager focusing on HIV/AIDS where I assisted in housing many homeless, educating the uneducated or misinformed, feeding the hungry, counseling and assisting many in getting their lives back from a life of hopelessness. Education has been in my blood for many years where I started out at 22 years of age with the Board of Education of the City of New York working with the Special Education Community. As the years passed and after my sordid life experience I saw all the injustices and that is when I started my journey towards Human and Civil Rights for ALL, lobbying, educating and counseling. I am here and I am NOT going anywhere.

My name is James and I am HIV-positive. I grew up in Wheaton, IL and in a good family enviorment. I was a happy child and had great childhood. After high school and two years of college, I met a wonderful and beautiful woman. She was perfect in everyway. We dated on and off and were the best of friends. Then one day it all changed. She didnt call as often, seemed out of it, and isolating herself. Around that time I heard one of her close friends turned out to be bi-sexual and had AIDS. I was a wreck and confronted her about it. After a few minutes she told me it was true and that she had had unprotected sex with him. By then I felt my stomach drop, and felt like the weight of the world was upon my shoulders. I then asked her had she been tested. She told me yes and that the results were positive. I was in shock, and I cried for days. My test results were positve and have been tested twice.

I am going on my 4th year since my diagnosis. Needless to say it has been a very difficult road to walk. When I first started getting sick I did not think it was anything more than the flu. Things got worse and worse untill I had a 104 degree (farenhiet) fever and I was out of my mind . I never even thought of A.I.D.S. as that I am straight and have never I.V.'d drugs , let alone share a needle. But as it turned out I had unprotected sex with a woman whose ex boyfriend was a junkie. When they whealed me into the hospital my blood oxygen level was 46 and my cd4 was 37. I was on deaths doorstep. I had full blown A.I.D.S. with collapsed lungs from pnumosystic pnumonia. I took my medications as directed and when I got out of the hospital my legs were so atrophied from being confined to bed that I could only walk a few steps at a time. My girlfriend ( who is uninfected and still by my side ) purchased an exercise bike and I worked on it daily untill I regained my strength. I have since been on numerous long distance treks and walkabouts. I have been in Backpacker Magazine for my hike in the U.S. on The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. I just got done in March 07 with hiking The Ouachita Trail in Arkansas. I am going to Montana in 2 weeks to do another project with Backpacker. I am also planning on walking across america starting in San Francisco on Feb 11 arriving in Washington D.C. on July 11th 2007 . The project is called The Longest Walk 2 . There is plenty on the net about it. I am seriously considering making an attempt on Mt Everest in the summer of 2009. I do not know if anyone with A.I.D.S has ever climbed it. I am not going to sit on my arse and wait around for Mr. Death. He will have to catch me first, and I hike like the devil himself is chasing me.

Ive read a few of these and decided to share my story and message in hopes it may help some people. My story starts when I was 22, I met a guy that I fell in love with and over time we began dating. When we started to talk about sex, he said he did not like to use condoms so i told him to go get tested and I would do the same. Keep in my mind we had been dating for 6 months by this time. My test came back negative, and next time we met he showed me a test and it also said negative. I started to get sick often, and the doctors thought id was simply a flu, needless to say I was converted hiv+. I confronted my boyfriend, and at first he denied it, but as i continually hounded for the truth he finally came clean. The test he showed me was old and he had been hiv+ since 2006 (before we met). He was also cheating on me the entire time we dated, spreading this diease to others. Today my T-cell count are very high, I take my meds everyday ontime and take care of myself. My message is this- If you have HIV and your partner does not...please disclose to them its our responsibility as hiv+ people to make sure the dieases ends with us. GO TO A DOCTOR!!!! AND GET MEDS!!!, there are county clinics that can help you for free example ADAP. IF you dont know your status go find out WITH your partner!! and always use condoms! Disclosing can be very scary pick the people you tell carefully some will be o.k. others wont know how to react. Go to the doctors frequently just to make sure your om and find out your t cells.

This past Feb 14, 2003 I have been positive for 1 year. It has been a very diffecult year, but I have gotten by and made it through my first year of HIV. I have been on meds since the begining, my viraload was over 13,000 and my cd4 count was like 396. We I am dwn to no dectectable and only up to 450. I have been on sustiva and combivir. Thanks to GOD the meds have not given my bad side effects but yes I do feel differnt being on the meds but hey they are helping live. I have only been able to tell a few close friends within the past year, and just recently las November I told my brother in the hospital when I developed celluitous, he at the same time outted himself as being gay. We shared a tear I told him I was okay and that the meds were helping me to live but I would be on the meds for the rest of my life. I guess what I am getting at is that how do I tell my parents and the rest of my brothers and sister that I am HIV positive. I come from a hispanic strong catholic back ground family. My parents are very heavily involed in the church, but we as family have never been such a close family, we have never been a family that expressed ones feelings. When I first came out to my parents being gay they took it very hard and very unsupported. Mom and Dad are not very educated and closed minded. Up until 3 years ago they finally expected my being gay lover after meeting him, but it took them about 6 years to accept it, now he is no longer my lover and have been single since then. It has been bothering me that I have not told my parents my sitution and feel that it would be a great weight off my should if I tell them. I wish I could someones opinion wheather they have gone through the same things or if I could get another gay hispanic who is catholic to see if they have gone through the same thing that I am going through.

Ended up in the hospital a few times and my counts when first diagnosed were CD4 of 57 and viral load of over 260,000. Am just wondering what to expect as I am on a constant regimin of antibiotics, anemia medication and HIV meds. Also, I have contacted two different ""support"" groups in the New Orleans area only to be told ""honey, there is nothing for you here, this is a 90% gay organization"" and the other for women supposedly to be told they can't offer any help with the meds financially because I work and really have no support groups for my ""type"". What a joke. I would love to get involved in organizations to help the spread of something like this or just get involved in some way.",http://www.hivaidspositivestories.com/text/st212.htmlAnonymous,All races/ethnicities,Female,13-24,All states,./images/anonymous.jpg,"i just found out i have hiv! i am 21 yrs old! i was helping my boyfriend move out of where he was at.

Staying on the meds was hard to do because I hated pills and drugs. I slipped and did not use a condom and to make it so bad.. I had cheated on my ex. Now the date isDecember 10th, 2006 and I am living well with Aids. The baby is now 8 and she is undetectable.:) The father whom I cheated on well , turns out, he was the one who gave it to me. It passed our first baby and that was a blessing. We were married for 5 years until he no longer supported me emotionally and he didn't want to go to a clinic to get medicine. So, I met another guy and we were married 8 months after we met. Why? well I was upfront with him because I was in love with him and after I told him- he asked me to marry him. And this March will be 2 years. We use protection all of the time. I was scared for my life but the longer I live..the more I except it, and you really do need a good support person and a good doctor. I'n not outspoken about it because it hurt me once..really bad but now I'm upfront to my daughter about her status so that she can grow with it as well as I have. When I used to think negative thoughts about telling her...there was a thought in my mind as to how she wmight react as a teenager.So I figured now is the time.

If anyone out there is listening please pay attention. I am HIV Positive I'm a 41 year old female hispanic. I was diagnosed in July 05, I was not aware that I was infected. I was in an abusive relationship 10 years ago, I have never done drugs, Iam not a smoker and I don't drink. I always lived a healthy life. This per knew that he was infected and did not give me a chance. But I should have been careful. My doctor gave me the news and went away for 2 weeks, did not referred me to the clinic or for counseling I didn't know where to go or who to talk to. I had a nervous breakdown I thought that my days were numbered. Was in the hospital for 2 weeks, had the shingles and a whole lot of stuff happened. To make my story short I am well now. I take two(2) pills at night and my viral load is undetectable, my tcells are going up. The reason why I am sharing my story is because I want to warn all of you that get diagnosed and go through the emotonal turmoil that I went thru. I joined a wellness group and a well known (AIDS)agency. At this group we share our fears our most deepest fellings with individuals that arealso HIV positive. Mentally I wasn't well I had to nurse myself back to health, was seeing a Pshychologist, a psychiatrist taking sleeping pills, anxiety pills, pills for my nerves the whole works and was suicidal. I WAS AFRAID TO DIE, I have two children and they need me here. I met a counselor at the agency he saw an easy target, I was of our state or mind. vulnerable. This person is also positive, he has been positive for the last 14 years. He gave me so much hope, when I was with him I would forget that I was positive, I went back to work, he helped me out of my depression. But the story doesn't have a happy ending. I have a fiancee but when he found out that I was positive he treats me like the worst person in the world. I cannot speak to him about hiv or my fears. my counselor (friend) was always saying that he needed some money to pay off his debts, he would say things like, I think that my viral load is sky high because Iam under so much stress and stuff like that. He borrowed $6,000.00 from me. He signed an agreement to pay back the full amount within the next 2 years. But he was a fake, he use his position to get close to me, and I was ignorant and stupid, I thought that I was returning the favor because he was always there for me. Well yesterday he was supposed to give a second payment on the loan. When I asked him about the money he came up with another one of his lies, I say this because after awhile I was catching on to his game._He is addicted to gambling, he gambled the $6,000.00, he gambled his weekly pay and then some. When I confronted him, he became verbally abusive, threatened me and all hell broke loose. I lost control of myself and one thing let to another and he was terminated from his job on the spot. He called me to acuse me of doing this to him, now I feel horrible I think that I am a monster for doing this. I have never hurt a person in my whole life, I feel so guilty. I can't stop from crying. I just want to know if I did the right thing or should have given him till the end of the month to come up with the moment. after all that i have went through and now this, my fiancee doesn't know about this, he is going to hate me even more. I lost the money that was the downpayment for the house that we were planning on buying. I don't know if I should take him to court or not, he doesn't return my calls. he had said to me now you have to give me money so I can leave the state because all of my clients how Iam going to face them.",http://www.hivaidspositivestories.com/text/st373.htmlAnonymous,Asian,Female,Adults and adolescents,Washington,./images/anonymous.jpg,"I am a mom and a wife.

I was in ICU for 3 days and not knowing were I was and didn't remmeber much. I was send home and still very sick. A year went by and my husband started having problems with his health. Then he got thrush and the doctor wanted him to be tested for HIV/AIDS we thought that was silly , knowing we have been married for 16 years at that time. So we did the test on him and found out that he has full blown AIDS. I was really scared for my kids now . I could handle it but feared for my 2 boys. I was tested and I have HIV . But I praise God that my kids don't have it. God spared them. I know I didn't get it untill years later. I did a life insurance and was tested 3 years before I found out.

Think of your children's future before you have kids. We are the one that make them pay for our past. Remember God will always love you, but just make the right chose in life.

Im very close with my family so I didnt hesitate to tell my parents immediately which has really helped me in this initial stage. I went home this weekened to explain everything to my parents while I tried to stay strong watching them break down with tears flying. It was tough but they came around quickly to be great support now and always. I know I caught this virus through unprotected sex with another man... Im into both men and women and I knew my lifestyle had some risk. I got tested every couple weeks because I became paranoid of not knowing. I actually studied hiv/aids on different occasions before I was diagnosed preparing myself just in case I became positive... but never thinking it would actually happen. So, yes, it was a big shock for me and still is a little bit. I guess I was in denial about my life choices and continued doing something I knew I didnt truely believe in... I mean everytime I hooked up I had to be high on some sort of drug... that cant be a good thing. The whole drug/sex scene was fascinating to me and I was sucked in by people I trusted... when really I should have trusted myself and what I knew was right and wrong. I cant blame anyone but myself. So whats next?... I know it may not be easy at times but I also know im not going to let something like this take control of my life... Im going to beat this. My goal is to find as much information as possible and continue to learn and grow. I believe it will make me a better person. I am very goal-oriented and sports minded... I have a ""never give up"" attitude. Ive been through a devastating illness before so its almost like my body has been groomed for this precarious road... Ive had full body paralysis and pneumonia amongst other things... ive beaten all of them... and I know its a result of TRUELY BELIEVING I will get through this. I am a positive person and not afraid of my positive status. So my sister asked me today if I felt ""scared""... I said ""no, not really... im aware of what people think they know but only God himself chooses the end to my story and I plan on helping him write that happy ending.""

My partner came from a het marriage with one child of 5 and wife was 4 months pregnant. All are negative (wife and kids). after a state of heavy disco drug use and final HIV fatigue - I became positive. I maintain the fact that I infected myself thorugh carelessness and love...No one is to blame -not even myself. I am interested in this idea that people are becoming fatigued to the message of safer sex -especially the 18-35 yr old age group. I beleive that this ""fatigue' is perhaps more ""fatalism' and recognise aspects of this line of thought in some of your very personal and frank stories, and beleive that people who 'slip-up' are so drawn to the idea that they have 'it' -due in part to the effective education that we here in Australia had at least, and a cycle of guilt and shame is created where people could have a three types of HIV status in one day. + then - and also unknown - The unknown being the most potent of them all. When I ceroconverted ( I don't know how to spell it but I know what it is) I went to the doctor straight away who within a 3 days of being tested informed me that I too had become infected. This maybe crazy for people to understand but I was so relieved to find out that I had it - and a tremendous weight had been lifted from my shoulders that I had been carrying around with me for some ten to fifteen years. As a response to the news, and to the luxury of of being employed in a steady and long term job in a WEstern Society, I took some time off to allow my body to heal, and then I made some decisions about what I was to do with the rest of my life. I took a series of meds that didn't make me sick. My TCell and Viral load went back to ""Normal"" (""great numbers "" My doc said). After some time off I quit my job and started in a less 'stressful' position, but more importantly I redefined my life goals. I have two beautiful children in my life who I love dearly, A partner that loves me and vice versa. Life does not end unless you want it to.

Mikey had always seemed to be sick but it wasn't until he was about 4 months old that we found out why. He was admitted to Akron Children's Hospital for a hernia. It was then that the Dr. asked if he could do an AIDS test. Well I was 17 at the time and never gave any thought to it actually coming back positive. Then two weeks later I was being told my son had full-blown AIDS and that meant I was + also. My mother tried to strangle me that day and just kept asking how could I co this to her. I still don't believe she realizes it's not what I did to her but to my children and me. See, I did not deal with this diagnosis very well and went into complete denial. Mikey passed away in Aug of 1990, but I was convinced that he did not die of AIDS that the Dr was wrong and that it was something else. My denial went on for the next two years resulting in giving birth to another AIDS-infected child, who was born three months early. Kayla became a lot sicker a lot quicker than Mikey but it wasn't until she was close to death that I began realizing that this disease was for real and now I had to deal with giving my two precious children AIDS. Which to this day is still very hard for me to deal with. At one point, the city & county health departments were going to have me committed because I was not dealing with the disease and was a risk to myself and others. Now I have finally began speaking publicly about my story and this disease but I still find it very hard to understand how or why so many people still put themselves at risk.

I agreed to allow a new test while I was there. To keep this short, I was in the hospital three times for a total of 24 days. Only 2 weeks ago was it determined that I had an anaerobic protozoan intestinal parasite (""Giardia Lamblia""). However.... my HIV test came back on Dec 19: positive. The doctor told me. He was very good, understanding, professional. The kind of person you would pray for to hear news like ""You're HIV positive"" from. He told me he was shocked that I was sitting there, smiling, calmly. He obviously wasn't used to such a reaction. I told him that if I were 30 years younger, I probably would be devastated. But I'm 53. With good care and the right meds, I'm more likely to die of other causes related to aging than HIV/AIDS complications. Sure, I'm adjusting.

I asked him wha was wrong and he said nothing and went to the bathroom. He came out freshly showered and smiling, we made lunch, sat together at the table, enjoyed the company of each other. After we were doing the dishes together and he started telling me a story of a boyfriend from the past. Long story short, he loved this man for 8 years and that man loved many others too in those 8 years! He then told me that he is HIV+, has been for 10 years. WHAT!!! I was so shocked! Shocked he chose to be intimate with somebody without disclosing his status! Shocked because he then told me that after he came, he pulled out, that the condom had broke and he ejaculated inside of me! 3 months later I was checked in at the ICU with a Macrobiotic infection, and Pneumonia. The next day was given a blood test looking for different things I suppose. Later that night the nurse came in with a stack of papers and a very sad look on her face. I asked about my test results and she said that my HIV test came back positive. I am only 27.
